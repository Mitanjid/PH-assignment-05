1. What is the difference between getElementById, getElementsByClassName, and querySelector / querySelectorAll?

Ans:
-> getElementById(id): Selects a single element based on its unique id attribute. HTML ids are intended to be unique within a document.

-> getElementsByClassName(className): Selects all elements that possess a specific class name.

->querySelector('selector') → Selects the first element that matches a CSS selector (e.g., #id, .class, div > p).

->querySelectorAll('selector') → Selects all elements matching a CSS selector. Returns a NodeList (static).
